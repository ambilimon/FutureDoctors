- [ ] Public directory contains all required static assets

## Deployment Process

1. **Push your code to GitHub**: Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to your repository.

2. **Import your project in Vercel**:
   - Log in to Vercel and click "Add New Project"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure the project:
     - Build Command: `npm run build` (already configured in vercel.json)
     - Output Directory: `dist` (already configured in vercel.json)
     - Framework Preset: `Vite` (already configured in vercel.json)

3. **Environment Variables**:
